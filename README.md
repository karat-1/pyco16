# Pyco16

**Pyco16** is a small personal game framework I built on top of [Pygame](https://pyga.me/). It's not intended as a full-fledged engine or library, but rather as a private framework that I use for my own small 2D games and prototypes.

Since it might be interesting for others to take a look at or tinker with, I've decided to share it publicly.

## What is it?

Pyco16 provides:
- A minimal structure for 2D games using Pygame
- Some helper classes for common game development tasks
- Full access to all of Pygame's native functionality
- A few patterns and utilities that I personally find useful

This is **not** a finished product or a library meant for general use. Feel free to explore, learn from it, or adapt parts for your own projects.
